##  100 Python Projects – My Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of **100 Python projects** I'm building to improve my coding skills. These projects start from basic concepts and progress to intermediate-level applications.

Each project is simple, practical, and built with a clear learning goal in mind.


##  Why This?
I believe in learning by doing. By completing 100 projects, I aim to:
- Master Python syntax and logic
- Practice problem-solving
- Build a personal portfolio of work
- Stay consistent and level up day by day


##  Project Structure

Each folder contains:
-  Source code (`.py` files)
-  A short README (optional) explaining what it does
-  Notes or challenges (if any)
