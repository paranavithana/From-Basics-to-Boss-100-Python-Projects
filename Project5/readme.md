# 📝 Simple Python Text-File Quiz

This is a basic Python quiz program that reads questions and answers from a text file and quizzes the user randomly.

## ✏️ How to Use

- 📚 Questions and their answers must be stored in a text file (`data2.txt`) in the format:  
  `[Question,Answer]` (one per line).
- 🎯 Enter how many quiz questions you want to attempt.
- 🔀 Questions will be picked randomly from the file.
- ✅ Type your answer and get instant feedback — whether you were correct or not!

If you ask for more questions than available, it will automatically quiz you with all available ones.
